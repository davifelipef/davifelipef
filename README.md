- 👋 Hi, I’m @davifelipef
- 👀 I’m interested in continuously studying 
programming so I can improve as a developer
- 🌱 I’m currently building most applications 
with Python, a language I fell in love with, 
but I also work with Javascript, HTML and CSS, 
besides studying React and, recently, React Native
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything 
that people think I might help
- 📫 You can reach me through this site or by
sending an email to feliperedfield@gmail.com
