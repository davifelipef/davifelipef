## About me
I am an IT student. I currently build most of my applications with Python and KivyMD, but I also like to work with Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3. 
I am also studying React, React Native and, recently, Jetpack Compose and Kotlin on the mobile side.

As a hobby, I draw pixel art for my fighting game.
